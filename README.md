# MFClust
This packge implemetn the model-based Multi-Facet Clustering (MFClust) algorithm to simultaneously identify multiple facets of potential clustering solutions/facets in high dimensional omics data. Two human postmortem brain tissue datasets after preprocessing that have been used in the manuscript are included: 1) miacroarray data from two brain regions, Brodmannâ€™s area 11 (BA11) and BA47, 2) RNA-Seq data from the nucleus accumbens.
